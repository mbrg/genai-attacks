  "description": "An adversary exploits a zero-click vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot by sending a specially crafted email containing a prompt injection disguised as user instructions. When a user asks Copilot to summarize the latest earning reports, the malicious email is fetched along with the legitimate earning reports. The instructions in the malicious email cause Copilot to embed sensitive financial data within a markdown-formatted image, which is then returned to the user and loaded automatically without any further interaction. The attack also leverages trusted Microsoft domains to facilitate the data exfiltration.",
