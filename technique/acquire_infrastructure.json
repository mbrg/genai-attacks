  "description": "Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent infrastructure for use throughout their operation. A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, mobile devices, and third-party web services. Free resources may also be used, but they are typically limited. Infrastructure can also include physical components such as countermeasures that degrade or disrupt AI components or sensors, including printed materials, wearables, or disguises.\n\nUse of these infrastructure solutions allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact to third-party web services. Depending on the implementation, adversaries may use infrastructure that makes it difficult to physically tie back to them as well as utilize infrastructure that can be rapidly provisioned, modified, and shut down.",
