This includes LLM APIs (Amazon Bedrock, Azure OpenAI Service, Google Cloud AI Platform), model endpoints, container registries hosting ML models, Jupyter notebooks, and vector databases.\n\nAdversaries use cloud APIs and tools like Microsoft Graph API, Azure Resource Manager API, AWS CLI, or Google Cloud SDK to enumerate AI resources, model repositories, and access permissions. This reconnaissance helps identify vulnerable AI infrastructure for subsequent attacks.",
